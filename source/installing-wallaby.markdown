Wallaby is open-source software and is easy to install and use.  However, it depends on recent versions of some support libraries --- perhaps more recent than downstream distributions have yet packaged.  In order to set up Wallaby and the configuration tools, you'll need the following packages:







  * [Apache Qpid](http://qpid.apache.org), client and server, at least version 0.7 and svn revision 929717.


  * Python and Ruby bindings for QMF (available with qpid)


  * [The Wallaby service](http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/grid/wallaby.git)


  * [The SPQR object management library](http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/grid/spqr.git)


  * [The Rhubarb object persistence library](http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/grid/rhubarb.git)


  * [The command-line configuration tools and the configd daemon](http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/grid/configuration-tools.git)





We hope to release tutorials and alpha binary packages for Fedora soon.  To find out when they arrive, please subscribe to [our syndication feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/EnterTheMarsupial)!
