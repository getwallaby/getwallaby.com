We had a great time at [Condor Week 2010](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/CondorWeek2010/) and are excited to announce Wallaby!   If you weren't there, you can [check out slides from our talk](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/CondorWeek2010/condor-presentations/benton-wallaby.pdf).  Whether you were there or not, please subscribe to [our syndication feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/EnterTheMarsupial) to keep up to date with new Wallaby developments, including prerelease packages, tutorials, Wallaby API tools, and official releases.
