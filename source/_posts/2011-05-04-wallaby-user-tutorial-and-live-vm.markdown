Rob Rati and I presented a Wallaby user tutorial at [Condor Week](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/CondorWeek2011/) yesterday.  Today, we have a [tutorial you can follow along with at home](http://getwallaby.com/tutorial-2011/), including a link to an EC2 AMI that boots up with Wallaby and Condor installed and running so you can experiment without installing anything. Enjoy!
