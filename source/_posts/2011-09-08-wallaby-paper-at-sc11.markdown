I'm pleased to announce that our paper "[Wallaby: A Scalable Semantic Configuration Service for Grids and Clouds](http://web.willbenton.com/research/sc11)" will be [presented at SC11 in the "State of the Practice" track on Clouds and Grids](http://sc11.supercomputing.org/schedule/event_detail.php?evid=sprac111).  If you're going to be at SC, I hope we'll be able to chat about Wallaby!
