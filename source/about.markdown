Wallaby is a sophisticated semantic configuration service for the Condor distributed job scheduling system.  Wallaby features remote API access with convenient bindings in several languages, automatic versioning, and a rich set of tools.  It is also open-source software, released under the Apache License.  (We like to think that Wallaby "incubates" configurations for your entire Condor pool.)  For more information about Wallaby, please see our talk from [Condor Week 2010](http://wallaby.freevariable.com/wallaby-talk.pdf).

Wallaby is sponsored by [Red Hat, Inc.](http://www.redhat.com), and is primarily developed by Red Hat engineers. This site is a community effort and is not sponsored or endorsed by Red Hat.
